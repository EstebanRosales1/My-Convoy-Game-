A 3D third-person convoy defense game built with Three.js. Protect your convoy from waves of enemies as it travels to the safe zone.

## Game Overview

In Convoy Shooter, you control a turret mounted on top of a truck convoy. Your mission is to defend the convoy from waves of enemies that attack from all directions. The convoy will automatically move forward toward the safe zone, and your job is to ensure it reaches its destination safely.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Use the mouse to aim the turret
